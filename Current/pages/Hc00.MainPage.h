\mainpage HackComputer

This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the
[NAnd2Tetris course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
\br
I wanted to explore a more in-depth perspective, so it does not strictly adhere to the course. 
Plus I wanted something self-contained in the end. In order to do that, the supplied tools
in the course materials were written from scratch.

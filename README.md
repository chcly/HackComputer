# Hack Computer

This repository is my implementation of the Hack computer in C++ from the
[NAnd2Tetris course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

The current written document for it can be found [here.](Current/markdown/index.md#hackcomputer)

## Testing

The Test directory is setup to work with [google test.](https://github.com/google/googletest)

The repository also contains the setup for commit testing the main [unit test](Test)
with GitHub actions.

## Current State

Is a work in progress, its on hold for the time being until more time is devoted to
it. I think its a neat toy because it allows a complete perspective from machine code
to high-level language execution. It could be expanded upon and taken to the finish line.
But at the end of the day it's only emulating the hardware system. If this were to work
efficiently from machine code executing on the hardware, up to running it in dart with Flutter.
Then another abstraction should be created to drop the hardware emulation layer and run it
on the physical CPU. [Similar to.](https://github.com/CharlesCarley/ToyVM)
